<!-- The purpose of this spec is to describe a new feature and
its APIs that make up a new feature in WinUI. -->

<!-- There are two audiences for the spec. The first are people
that want to evaluate and give feedback on the API, as part of
the submission process.  When it's complete
it will be incorporated into the public documentation at
docs.microsoft.com (http://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/).
Hopefully we'll be able to copy it mostly verbatim.
So the second audience is everyone that reads there to learn how
and why to use this API. -->

# Background
<!-- Use this section to provide background context for the new API(s) 
in this spec. -->

<!-- This section and the appendix are the only sections that likely
do not get copied to docs.microsoft.com; they're just an aid to reading this spec. -->

<!-- If you're modifying an existing API, included a link here to the
existing page(s) -->

<!-- For example, this section is a place to explain why you're adding this API rather than
modifying an existing API. -->

<!-- For example, this is a place to provide a brief explanation of some dependent
area, just explanation enough to understand this new API, rather than telling
the reader "go read 100 pages of background information posted at ...". -->

In WinUI 2.2, controls began to be re-designed to have rounded corners, marking a shift in our overall design language. 
There's more information on rounded corners in WinUI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/style/rounded-corner), 
but the general purpose of the rounded corners design shift is to evoke warmth and trust, 
and make the UI easier for users to visually process. 
Since this shift, certain controls have adopted the new styling and recieved rounded corners, but some have not. 
This creates a strong visual inconsistency in WinUI apps, where certain pieces of an app may look modern and others may look dated. 
Examples of this include the DatePicker and TimePicker controls. While the corners of the controls themselves are rounded, the selection rectangle within the control is still squared off. Buttons and other areas inside these controls are also still squared off, making them look dated when placed alongside other controls that are more modernly designed, such as 
[NavigationView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/navigationview).

Recently, [ListView was given design updates](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml-specs/blob/user/anawish/ListViewGridViewDesignUpdates/active/ListViewGridView/listviewgridview-designupdates.md) to round the corners of its items. DatePicker and TimePicker should follow in these footsteps, and make sure that they adopt any of the ListView design elements that are relevant. This includes general rounding of selection visuals, as well as rounded grey backplates for items that get hovered. 

This spec will detail a number of changes to update the designs of DatePicker and TimePicker so that they are more 
visually aligned with modern WinUI controls. At a high level, some key parts of these updated styles are: a rounded selection rectangle; rounded backplates on items, buttons, and scroll buttons on  hover; and new animations that are aligned with other controls. 

There is only one major API change that will come with these styling updates, which is adding a new class called `ColorFilterOverlayControl`. This class provides the logic behind displaying the 'inverted' selection rectangle that spans across all three columns in DatePicker and TimePicker, and giving it the correct foreground color to have appropriate contrast over the accent colored background.

# Visual Examples
<!-- Use this section to provide a brief description of the feature.
For an example, see the introduction to the PasswordBox control 
(http://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/password-box). -->

**DatePicker:**

As you can see on the left, the old version of DatePicker contains squared elements inside of it. The new version of DatePicker will round off these elements.

**TimePicker:**

Similarly to DatePicker, the old version of TimePicker contains squared elements inside of it. The new version of TimePicker will round off these elements.

**Rounded backplates and focus visuals**

As you can see in the mockup below, all buttons and items (individual cells) within DatePicker and TimePicker will receive a rounded grey backplate when hovered or pressed. In addition to this, columns within DatePicker and TimePicker will receive rounded focus rectangles (as shown below).

# API Notes
<!-- Option 1: Give a one or two line description of each API (type
and member), or at least the ones that aren't obvious
from their name.  These descriptions are what show up
in IntelliSense. For properties, specify the default value of the property if it
isn't the type's default (for example an int-typed property that doesn't default to zero.) -->

<!-- Option 2: Put these descriptions in the below API Details section,
with a "///" comment above the member or type. -->

## New APIs

`public Class ColorFilterOverlayControl`

Represents a class that takes a rectangle and transforms into the coordinate space of a TargetElement, and then runs a ColorMatrixEffect on that region to select the alpha channel and replace with a ReplacementColor.

`public UIElement TargetElement { get; set; }`

Gets or sets the UIElement to apply the color effect to. 

`public Color ReplacementColor { get; set; }`

Gets or sets the Color to use instead of the RGB channels of the TargetElement.

## New ThemeResources

```xml
<StaticResource x:Key="DatePickerFlyoutPresenterHighlightForegroundColor" ResourceKey="TextOnAccentAAFillColorPrimary" />
```

# API Details
<!-- The exact API, in MIDL3 format (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/midl-3/) -->

```csharp
namespace Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls
{

[MUX_PROPERTY_CHANGED_CALLBACK(TRUE)]
[MUX_PROPERTY_CHANGED_CALLBACK_METHODNAME("OnPropertyChanged")]
unsealed runtimeclass ColorFilterOverlayControl : Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Grid
{
    ColorFilterOverlayControl();

    Windows.UI.Xaml.UIElement TargetElement { get; set; };
    Windows.UI.Color ReplacementColor { get; set; };

    static Windows.UI.Xaml.DependencyProperty TargetElementProperty{ get; };
    static Windows.UI.Xaml.DependencyProperty ReplacementColorProperty{ get; };
}

}
```

# Examples
The example below shows how the new `ColorFilterOverlayControl` API can be used to partially highlight a TextBlock.

```xml
 <Grid Background="{ThemeResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}">
        <StackPanel x:Name="Panel" Orientation="Vertical" HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center">
            <Grid Margin="2,10,0,0">
                <TextBlock x:Name="Target" Text="This string will be partially highlighted"/>
                <ColorFilterOverlayControl
                    ReplacementColor="Black"
                    TargetElement="{Binding ElementName=Target}"
                    Width="50"
                    VerticalAlignment="Stretch"
                    HorizontalAlignment="Center"
                    Background="LightBlue"/>
            </Grid>
        </StackPanel>
    </Grid>
```

# Appendix
<!-- Anything else that you want to write down for posterity, but 
that isn't necessary to understand the purpose and usage of the API.
For example, implementation details. -->
## Detailed Task Breakdown for styling implementation
The following steps apply to both DatePicker and TimePicker, unless otherwise noted.

1. The background color of the overall flyout should change, as shown in mockups above.

2. Selected items (entire rows) should have a rounded (4px corner radius) accent-color backplate. This backplate should have a 32px height, and have 4px margin on the left/right and 2px margin on the top/bottom from its overall footprint. 

3. When items (individual cells, i.e. "November") are in a hover or pressed state, they will have a rounded (4px corner radius) grey backplate, with the same margins from its overall footprint as the selection row has described above. This backplate should also be 32px in height. 

4. The scroll up/down button visuals should use caret icons (rather than the current chevron icons). 

5. When the scroller buttons are hovered, they should have a rounded grey backplate that have a height of 12px, and a 4px margin on all sides from their overall button footprints.

6. The check and X buttons at the bottom of the Date/TimePicker should also be updated to use new icons as shown in mockups above.

7. On hover, the check and X buttons should also receive a rounded gray backplate with 4px margins on all sides from its overall button footprint.

8. Focus visuals for all buttons need to be rounded. 

9. **DatePicker only**: Items in columns should now be left-aligned, rather than center-aligned as they were previously.Â 

10. Columns within an expanded Date/TimePicker can be focused upon. For the column focus, the black focus rectangle will need to be rounded.

11. Animations: Date/TimePicker should have an opening/closing animation and use the same easing/timing as other controls.
