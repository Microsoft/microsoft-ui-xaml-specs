<!-- The purpose of this API spec is to describe a new API or
set of related APIs that make up a new feature in WinUI. -->

<!-- There are two audiences for the spec. The first are people
that want to evaluate and give feedback on the API, as part of
the submission process.  When it's complete
it will be incorporated into the public documentation at
docs.microsoft.com (http://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/).
Hopefully we'll be able to copy it mostly verbatim.
So the second audience is everyone that reads there to learn how
and why to use this API. -->

# Background
<!-- Use this section to provide background context for the new API(s) 
in this spec. -->

<!-- This section and the appendix are the only sections that likely
do not get copied to docs.microsoft.com; they're just an aid to reading this spec. -->

<!-- If you're modifying an existing API, included a link here to the
existing page(s) -->

<!-- For example, this section is a place to explain why you're adding this API rather than
modifying an existing API. -->

<!-- For example, this is a place to provide a brief explanation of some dependent
area, just explanation enough to understand this new API, rather than telling
the reader "go read 100 pages of background information posted at ...". -->


# Overview
<!-- Use this section to provide a brief description of the API(s). -->

<!-- For an example, see the introduction to the PasswordBox control 
(http://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/password-box). -->


# Examples
<!-- Use this section to explain the features of the API, showing
example code with each description. -->

<!-- For an example, see the Examples section for the PasswordBox control 
(https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/password-box#examples). -->

# API Notes
<!-- Give a one or two line description of each API (type
and member), or at least the ones that aren't obvious
from their name.  These descriptions are what show up
in IntelliSense. -->


# API Details

<!-- The exact API, in MIDL3 format (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/midl-3/) -->

# Appendix
<!-- Anything else that you want to write down for posterity, but 
that isn't necessary to understand the purpose and usage of the API.
For example, implementation details. -->
