# Background
> Use this section to provide background context for the new API(s) in this spec.
 This is the only section of this spec that likely won't be posted to the final
 documentation at docs.microsoft.com.

> For example, this is a place to explain why you're adding this API rather than
modifying an existing API.

> For example, this is a place to provide a brief explanation of some related
area that's just enough to understand this new API, rather than telling
the reader "go read 100 pages of background information posted ...".


# Overview and How To
> Use this section to provide an overview, descriptions, and example
code.  The majority of your content should be here.

> Recommended format:
>* Description
>* Why use this API?
>* Basic/typical usage
>* Interesting features
>       (description/example, description/example, ...)
>* Advanced by relevant scenarios 
(description/example, description/example, ...)


# API notes

## Class 1
> *One-two line description that will show up in Intellisense*

> Remarks about this class.  When this is incorporated into
docs.microsoft.com, the basic/typical usage example from the
How To section may be copied here as well.

### Member 1.1
> *One or two line description that will show up in Intellisense*

> Remarks about this member

> Descriptions (with examples) for this member that were too
advanced to put into the How To section.

### Member 1.2
> *One-two line description that will show up in Intellisense*

### Additional member notes
> For members that are pretty obvious from the name,
but for which you'd like to at least give the 1-line Intellisense
description, create a table here of membe/type/description.

# API

>The exact API, in IDL format.  This will not be copied to
docs.microsoft.com, as the API details sections are generated
automatically from the built metadata.

# Appendix
> Anything else that you want to write down for posterity, but 
that isn't necessary to understand the purpose and usage of the API.
For example, implementation details.
