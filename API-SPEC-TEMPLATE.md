> The purpose of this  API spec is to  describe a new API or
set of related APIs that make up a new feature in WinUI.

> There are two audiences for the spec. The first are people
that want to evaluate and give feedback on the API, as part of
the submission process.  When it's complete
it will be incorporated into the public documentation at
[docs.microsoft.com](http://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui/).
Hopefully we'll be able to copy it mostly verbatim.
So the second audience is everyone that reads there to learn how
and why to use this API.

# Background
> Use this section to provide background context for the new API(s) in this spec.

> This section and the appendix are the only sections that likely
do not get copied to docs.microsoft.com; they're just an aid to reading this spec.

> For example, this section is a place to explain why you're adding this API rather than
modifying an existing API.

> For example, this is a place to provide a brief explanation of some dependent
area,  just explanation enough to understand this new API, rather than telling
the reader "go read 100 pages of background information posted at ...".


# Overview and How Tos
> Use this section to provide an overview, descriptions, and example
code.  The majority of your content should be here.

> Recommended format:
>* Description
>* Why use this API?
>* Basic/typical usage example
>* Interesting features
>       (description/example, description/examexple, ...)
>* Advanced but relevant scenarios 
(description/example, description/example, ...)

> Note that if you're just adding members to an existing class,
you probably don't need this section; it's easier to just
put it into the API Reference section below.

> For an example, see the 
[PasswordBox control](http://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/design/controls-and-patterns/password-box).

# API Reference

## Foo Class
> *One or two line description that will show up in Intellisense*

> Add additional remarks about this type, if necessary, here.  
When this is incorporated into
docs.microsoft.com, the basic/typical usage example from the
'How To' section may be copied here as well.

### Member Foo.A
> *One or two line description that will show up in Intellisense*

> Remarks about this member

> Descriptions (with examples) for this member that were too
advanced to put into the How To section.

### Member A.B
> *One-two line description that will show up in Intellisense*
...

### Additional member notes
> For members that are pretty obvious from the name,
but for which you'd like to at least give the 1-line Intellisense
description, create a table here of name/type/description here.

## Bar Class

### Member Bar.A
### Member Bar.B

# API Details

>The exact API, in IDL format.

# Appendix
> Anything else that you want to write down for posterity, but 
that isn't necessary to understand the purpose and usage of the API.
For example, implementation details.
